## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### What We Access:

✅ **Tab domains only** (e.g., "github.com")  
✅ **Your manual grouping preferences** (stored locally)

### What We DON'T Access:

❌ Page content or browsing history  
❌ Passwords or personal data

## 📡 How It Works

### Architecture:

```
You → Extension → Secure Backend (Vercel) → Claude AI → Results → Groups Created
```

1. **Extension** collects tab titles and domains
2. **Backend** securely calls Claude AI with your data
3. **AI** suggests categories (Development, Social, Shopping, etc.)
4. **Extension** creates tab groups automatically
5. **Learning** happens locally - your preferences stay in your browser

### Why a Backend?

- 🔒 **Security** - API key never exposed in extension code
- 💰 **Free for you** - We cover the AI costs
- ⚡ **Fast** - Optimized API calls
- 📊 **Fair usage** - 10 free organizes/month per user

---

## 🧠 How Learning Works

The extension learns from your behavior:

1. **First time:** AI makes best guess at categorization
2. **You adjust:** Manually drag tabs between groups
3. **It learns:** Remembers "github.com goes in Development"
4. **Next time:** Automatically uses your preferences

**All learning happens locally** - your preferences never leave your browser!

## 📊 What Gets Sent to AI

When you click "Organize Tabs":

### ✅ Sent to our secure backend:
```
0. GitHub - Pull Request (github.com)
1. Gmail (mail.google.com)
2. Twitter (twitter.com)
```

### ❌ NOT sent:
- Full URLs (e.g., `github.com/your-company/secret-project`)
- Page content or text
- Passwords or form data
- Your browsing history
- Cookies or session data

**Only tab titles and domain names - that's it!**

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### macOS (Chrome & Brave)

Tab group names may not display immediately on macOS. This is a browser rendering issue on Mac.

**Workaround:** Groups are created correctly - names appear after clicking into any tab in the group.

**Status:** This affects all tab group extensions on macOS and cannot be fixed from the extension side.

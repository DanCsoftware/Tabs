## 🧠 How Learning Works

The extension learns from your behavior:

1. **First time:** AI makes best guess at categorization
2. **You adjust:** Manually drag tabs between groups
3. **It learns:** Remembers "github.com goes in Development"
4. **Next time:** Automatically uses your preferences

**All learning happens locally** - nothing sent to servers!
